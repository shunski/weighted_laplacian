# Instruction on running
1. Make sure that the Rust compiler is installed. (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Create the folder `program_outputs` at the root. This folder will contain the program outputs, such as graphs and plots in the form of png files and gif files.
3. Any binary sourse files are in `src/bin` folder. To run the binary named `src/bin/BIN_NAME.rs`, use the command `cargo run --bin BIN_NAME --release`. The results will be stored in `program_outputs` folder that is created in the step 2.
